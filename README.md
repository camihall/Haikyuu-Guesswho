# Haikyuu-Guesswho
Play a fun game of Guess Who except with Haikyuu characters. Click on a face tile to "flip" it over once you eliminate a character. 

Parts that still need to be worked on:
Keep track of wins and losses by clicking either won of lost button after each game. 
Make board refresh with a count of wins and losses.
Allow player to chose their character and show that character's face somewhere on the screen for the whole game.
